# SpringSecurity-ReactJs-JwtAuthentication-ToDoApp

## BACKEND

Rest Api's are created using Spring Security for registering a new user and signing in. \ 
MySql Database is used for storing user details, 
and JWT authentication is done when the user tries to log in. 

## FRONTEND

In this project, I've integrated spring boot with ReactJs that renders login and register page  
and after authentication to-do list page. To-do List is completely made using ReactJs.
 
### npm start
